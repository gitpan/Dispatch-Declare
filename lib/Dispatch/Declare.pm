=head1 NAME

Dispatch::Declare - Build a hash based dispatch table declaratively


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Dispatch::Declare version 0.0.9


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dispatch::Declare;

    my $action = 'ADDUSER';

    declare REPAIRDB => sub {
        print 'This is a REPAIRDB test' . "\n";
    };

    declare ADDUSER => sub {
        print 'This is a ADDUSER test' . "\n";
    };

    run $action;
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Large if-else statement can be trouble or as the PBP calls them cascading ifs. I also
find that large hash/dispatch tables can lead to trouble too. If you make a syntax error the line given
could be at the end of the control structure. I thought most of the problems could be solved with
a little syntax.


=head1 INTERFACE 

    There are only two subroutines exported, declare and run.
    declare is where you setup you dispatch table.

=over 4

=item declare

    declare KEY1 => sub {
        ...
    };
    
    declare KEY2 => sub {
        ...
    };

=item declare_once

    Only allow a key to be set once.

    declare_once KEY1 => sub { # Set KEY1
        ...
    };
    
    declare_once KEY1 => sub { # Error
        ...
    };
    
    declare KEY1 => sub { # Error
        ...
    };

=item undeclare

   undeclare 'KEY1';

   Now KEY1 has been remove from the table.

=item run

    Then to call your action:
    my $key = 'KEY1';
    run $key, @args;
    
    That all there is to it.

=item DEFAULT key
    If you make one of your keys DEFAULT it will be executed if no other keys match.

    declare DEFAULT => sub {
        ...
    };

    run; # runs DEFAULT action

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
Dispatch::Declare requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

1. The value part of the declare must be a code ref.
2. Only one dispatch table can be used.

No bugs have been reported.
